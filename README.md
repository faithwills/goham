Course: COMS 4170 User Interface Design 

Our target population is Columbia University students who may be less motivated to exercise due to COVID-19’s impact on student lifestyles. These students may have limited access to exercise due to the shutdown of gyms and discouragement of social gatherings.

Our problem statement is that during quarantine, students are prone to developing sedentary lifestyles due to the closure of exercise facilities and discouragement of small gatherings. Thus, it is easy for students to lack the motivation to exercise. Our specific subproblem is to help students find their motivation. It is an important subproblem because exercise is an essential part of a healthy, balanced life that is too often overshadowed by school stress. 

Our design solution will encourage motivation through synced exercise video calls and gamification. For example, two friends may schedule a meet up to work out together and follow video instructions together while on the call. If a user wants to have a spontaneous workout and meet other Columbia students, they can visit virtual locations on the game map, each of which would be designated for a different type of exercise. Users can then easily find new friends to workout with while building a community within GoHam!
